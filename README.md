__MapTrek__ is designed for hiking, geocaching, off-roading, cycling, boating and all other outdoor activities. It uses offline maps so you do not need to have internet connection. You can easily import waypoints and tracks from GPX and KML data formats or create waypoints in application and share them to others. It lets you write the track of your journey, even in background, so you will never get lost and be able later see where you've been.

MapTrek is developed as a hobby for personal use but is generously shared to public on as-is basis. Developers are welcome to contribute to the project. Specifically experts in OpenGL and PostGIS are much needed.

The development is on alpha stage now which means that much of desired functionality is not ready yet.
